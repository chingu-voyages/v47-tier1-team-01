**Runnning the project:**

- Fork this repository
- Clone your forked repository

```cd <your-project-name>```


- Open the HTML file in a web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the HTML file, or you can use a command in the terminal. For example, if you’re using a Unix-like terminal, you could use:

*Please replace <your-project-name> with the actual name of your project directory.

**Dependencies:**

This project does not require any packages to run. However, it does use the following external scripts which are loaded directly in the HTML:

- Font Awesome: This is used for icons in the project. The script is loaded from https://kit.fontawesome.com/bb8e411a96.js.
- DOMPurify 3.0.8: This is a JavaScript library that sanitizes HTML and prevents XSS attacks. The script is loaded from https://unpkg.com/dompurify@3.0.8/dist/purify.min.js.

These scripts need to be available and able to be loaded for the project to function correctly. If you’re running the project locally and offline, you’ll need to make sure these scripts are available offline as well.
